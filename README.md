FAQ
---

### How many FPS should I get to set my shader as live wallpaper?

Some devices limit GPU usage to consume less power when not plugged in.
Always check the performance with the soft keyboard hidden and the power
cord off. A shader should make at least around 30 fps to not slow down
the UI.

### How much battery will a live wallpaper take?

A live wallpaper should only consume battery when you see it.
So it generally depends on how often and how long you look at it.
With normal use, you shouldn't note a difference in battery consumption.

### What if errors are not highlighted?

Unfortunately error information is disabled on some devices (e.g. Huawei
Ideos X3, Asus Transformer). Error highlighting/reporting is not possible
on these devices.
